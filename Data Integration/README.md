In this course, we explored the foundations of data integration techniques and their applications to big data. We utilized various tools, including Hadoop, Apache Spark, MapReduce, and cloud computing, to effectively manage and analyze data. This project aims to demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the module by applying these techniques in practical scenarios.

The project is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on building a machine learning classifier using Apache Spark, showcasing the process and outcomes. The second part compares the efficiency of parallel computing with traditional computing methods, highlighting the advantages and performance differences observed.

The dataset used in the first part is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction
